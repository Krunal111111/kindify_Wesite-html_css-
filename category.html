          <p>Food Distribution delivers nutritious ready-to-eat meals and household grocery kits to families facing immediate food insecurity.</p>
          <p>We prioritise households with children, elderly members, pregnant women and daily-wage workers who have lost income.</p>
          <p>Local, verified partners prepare balanced meals or assemble ration boxes containing staples such as rice, pulses, oil and spices.</p>
          <p>Distribution rounds are scheduled and beneficiaries are verified to avoid duplication and ensure fairness.</p>
          <p>Volunteers and partners maintain lists and capture delivery receipts, photos and short beneficiary notes for transparency.</p>
          <p>Donors receive concise reports showing numbers served, photos and confirmation of receipt where possible.</p>
          <p>We value dignity: food is distributed respectfully at community centres or directly at homes when necessary.</p>
          <p>Emergency food packs are reserved for sudden crises such as floods, job loss or local disasters.</p>
          <p>Repeat distributions can be organised as short-term or monthly support based on assessed need.</p>
          <p>The program reduces hunger immediately and supports families while longer-term recovery plans are arranged.</p>

        html: `
          <p>School Bag Distribution supplies backpacks, notebooks, pens and essential stationery to children from under-resourced families.</p>
          <p>Each kit is assembled to match age groups and school-grade requirements so children receive appropriate learning materials.</p>
          <p>We partner with schools and local trusts to identify students who will benefit most and to prevent overlap.</p>
          <p>Distributions are coordinated during school visits or community events with verification checks.</p>
          <p>Reports include beneficiary names, photos and short notes confirming receipt to increase donor trust.</p>
          <p>Local partners may include additional learning aids such as geometry sets, storybooks or basic calculators when suitable.</p>
          <p>Donations help remove a barrier to attendance and allow children to engage more confidently in class.</p>
          <p>We track outcomes where possible, noting improved attendance or positive feedback from teachers.</p>
          <p>School bag programs are timed ahead of academic years or exam seasons for immediate effect.</p>
          <p>Community involvement ensures kits reach the right children with accountability and care.</p>

          <p>Uniform Distribution provides clean, durable school uniforms to children who cannot afford them, promoting equality and dignity.</p>
          <p>Uniforms reduce visible economic differences and help children focus on learning rather than appearance.</p>
          <p>We work with school administrators and verified trusts to collect size details and ensure correct matching.</p>
          <p>Uniforms are sourced responsibly — prioritising durable fabrics suitable for local climate and frequent use.</p>
          <p>Distribution events are documented with beneficiary lists and photos to maintain transparency for donors.</p>
          <p>Where required, we include smaller items like belts or shoes as part of coordinated support packages.</p>
          <p>Local partners may also provide guidance on caring for uniforms to extend usable life.</p>
          <p>Timing aligns with school terms so children receive uniforms when they return to class.</p>
          <p>Programs aim to reduce dropout risk by removing a common barrier to school attendance.</p>
          <p>Donors can see impact reports that confirm how many children were supported and where uniforms were distributed.</p>

          <p>We collaborate with educators and local partners to select age-appropriate and language-appropriate materials.</p>
          <p>Distribution supports classroom libraries, reading corners and take-home resources for students who lack materials.</p>
          <p>Donated books are catalogued and allocated so that they complement school curricula and learning goals.</p>
          <p>Reports include counts of books distributed, school or center names and beneficiary feedback.</p>
          <p>Where possible, children receive reading sessions or orientation to make the best use of new materials.</p>
          <p>Programs encourage literacy, curiosity and sustained reading habits among young learners.</p>
          <p>We prioritise remote and low-resource communities where access to books is limited.</p>
          <p>Impact is measured by improved reading engagement and teacher feedback over time.</p>
          <p>Donors receive evidence of distribution and notes on how books are used in learning spaces.</p>

          <p>Local partners determine package sizes based on household composition to ensure fair allocation.</p>
          <p>Emergency grocery support is prioritised for sudden crises — job loss, floods or other disruptions.</p>
          <p>All distributions are recorded with receipts, beneficiary confirmations and photos for transparency.</p>
          <p>Recurring support programs can be arranged for a short period while families stabilise their income sources.</p>
          <p>Verification by trusted NGOs ensures that assistance reaches intended households without misuse.</p>
          <p>Impact includes reduced hunger, better nutrition and time for families to find longer-term solutions.</p>
          <p>Donors receive concise reports that highlight numbers of households helped and distribution evidence.</p>

          <p>School Fee Donation covers tuition, exam fees and administrative costs for students from low-income families.</p>
          <p>Funds are transferred through verified partner trusts to ensure proper allocation and accountability.</p>
          <p>Partners confirm student eligibility with school records and issue receipts for donor visibility.</p>
          <p>Support can be one-time for an academic term or recurring to sustain a student through the year.</p>
          <p>Programs focus on children at immediate risk of dropping out due to fee barriers.</p>
          <p>Donors receive follow-up reports confirming enrolment and how funds were applied.</p>
          <p>Where appropriate, mentorship or tutoring support is coordinated alongside fee support to improve outcomes.</p>
          <p>The goal is to keep children in school and ensure continuity of learning.</p>
          <p>Transparent reporting and partner verification build donor confidence and program integrity.</p>

          <p>Footwear Distribution supplies sturdy shoes or sandals to children and adults who need protection for daily travel and school.</p>
          <p>Proper footwear reduces injuries, infections and discomfort that can prevent regular attendance at school or work.</p>
          <p>Size collection is coordinated via schools or community visits to ensure correct fitting.</p>
